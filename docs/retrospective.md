# Project Retrospective: PixelQuest Hub

## What Went Well
- **Repository Setup:** Creating the GitHub repository and enabling Pages was straightforward and successful on the first attempt.
- **Documentation:** Writing the scope and plan documents helped clarify the projectâ€™s purpose and structure.
- **Prototype:** Building the two-page prototype was manageable, and the navigation between pages worked smoothly.

## What Went Wrong
- **CSS Styling:** Achieving a consistent and visually appealing design took longer than expected. Some layout adjustments required trial and error.
- **Time Management:** Balancing the writing of documentation with coding the prototype was more challenging than anticipated, leading to some last-minute adjustments.

## What I Would Do Differently
- **Start Earlier on the Prototype:** Beginning the HTML/CSS work sooner would have allowed more time for design experimentation and refinement.
- **Seek Feedback Sooner:** Sharing drafts of the prototype and documents earlier could have provided helpful feedback before final submission.
- **Expand Styling Knowledge:** Reviewing more CSS resources in advance would have reduced time spent troubleshooting design issues.

## Closing Thoughts
Overall, the process of creating the Project 03 proposal package was a valuable learning experience. It combined project management skills with technical web development practice, resulting in a professional portfolio piece that demonstrates the ability to plan, document, and prototype a digital project.
