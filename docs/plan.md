- Basic HTML/CSS knowledge is sufficient to complete the prototype.

**Managerial Risks**
- Time management challenges balancing documentation and prototype development.
- Risk of underestimating the time required for revisions and testing.

**Environmental Risks**
- Dependence on reliable internet access for GitHub and Pages deployment.
- Browser compatibility issues could affect how the site is displayed.
