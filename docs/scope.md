# Project Scope Statement: PixelQuest Hub

## Project Overview
PixelQuest Hub is a proposed website dedicated to video games, designed to highlight reviews, recommendations, and gaming culture. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the concept of a gaming-focused website through a small prototype and supporting documentation. This proposal package showcases the ability to plan, document, and prototype a digital project from conception to delivery.

## Objectives
- Create a professional project proposal package for a new website project.
- Build a two-page HTML/CSS prototype to illustrate the concept.
- Document the scope, plan, and retrospective of the proposal process.

## Deliverables
- **Two-page website prototype** (index.html and about.html) styled with CSS.
- **Documentation folder** containing:
  - `scope.md` (this document)
  - `plan.md` (project plan with risk analysis and task schedule)
  - `retrospective.md` (reflection on the proposal process)
- **README.md** introducing the proposed website project and linking to the live prototype.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary Stakeholder:** Instructor (evaluating the project proposal package).
- **Secondary Stakeholders:** Classmates (peer reviewers), potential gaming community (future audience for the proposed site).

## Constraints
- Prototype limited to basic HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or backend).
- Timeframe restricted to the semester schedule.
- Scope limited to a two-page prototype, not a full implementation of the envisioned website.

## Success Criteria
- Repository is public, well-documented, and professional.
- GitHub Pages successfully hosts the prototype.
- Documentation clearly communicates the project scope, plan, and reflection.
- Prototype demonstrates the concept of a gaming website in a simple, functional way.
